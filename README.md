# Golang DDD starter

This repository is a successor of my older project called
[golang-gin-gorm-starter](https://github.com/henvo/golang-gin-gorm-starter). It
makes use of the domain-driven principles to structure the project in
a meaningful and future-proof way. It was inspired by Ben Johnsons
[article](https://www.gobeyond.dev/standard-package-layout/) about standard
package layout for Go projects.
